           <h1>This is my biography! (Nicholas Ong)</h1>
           <p>
             Hello, my name is Nicholas Ong and I was born and raised in Providence, Rhode Island.
             I'm Cambodian-American, and I am a first generation college student going to Brandeis University
             My birthday is on June 23rd, 2001
           </p>

          <ul>
          I know how to solve a Rubik's Cube in 38 seconds
          </ul>
          <ul>
        I never broke a bone in my body
        </ul>
        <ul>
          I have a PomChi named Cali, we've had her for about 5 years.
        </ul>
        <ul>
          I have a picture down there of me with Bruno the Bear from Brown University,
          I'm pretty passionate about letting other people know that there are so many more
          important aspects to Providence than Brown University, and no one really knows what
          goes on there other than Brown.
